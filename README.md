##Configuration

Search Guard SSL configuration is done in elasticsearch.yml. Please refer to [searchguard-ssl-config-template.yml](searchguard-ssl-config-template.yml) to see the configuration options and their defaults.

Check your configuration by visiting [https://localhost:9200/_searchguard/sslinfo?pretty](https://localhost:9200/_searchguard/sslinfo?pretty) if you have enabled HTTPS or [http://localhost:9200/_searchguard/sslinfo?pretty](http://localhost:9200/_searchguard/sslinfo?pretty) if HTTPS is not enabled.

For details refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard-ssl/wiki).
If you are running Elasticsearch 2.0.x or 2.1.x you to [disable your security manager](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard-ssl/wiki/Disable-security-manager).

###Logging
Configured in elasticsearch's logging.yml. Nothing special. To enable debug just add

``logger.com.floragunn.searchguard.ssl: DEBUG``

###SSL Certificates
* Refer to [wiki](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard-ssl/wiki/Generate-Keystores) and [example-pki-scripts](example-pki-scripts) how to generate the certificates. It's strongly recommended to use a root certificate.
